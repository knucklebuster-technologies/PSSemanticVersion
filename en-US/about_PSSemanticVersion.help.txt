SHORT DESCRIPTION
    How to use PSSemanticVersion Cmdlets and Objects

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Creates and returns a semantic version 2.0 compliant .net
    object. The returned objects properties are set using the
    default or supplied parameters. the returned object has a
    set of ScriptMethods to help with using the object.
    METHODS:
    ToString - Returns a semver 2.0 formatted string example:
        v1.0.13-ctp+123
    Parse - Takes a semver 2.0 formatted string
        (1.0.23-ctp+123) and sets the objects properties
        from the formatted string. Returns True if updated
        or False if not updated.
    FromVersionJson - Takes the folder path that contains
        the version.json file to use. The json is used to
        set the properties on the object. Returns True if
        the properties are updated and False if they are not.
    ToVersionJson - Takes the folder path to write the
        version.json file. The file is recreated each
        time the object is serialized to json. Returns
        True if file is created and False if it is not.
    FromSystemVersion - Takes a System.Version object and
        updates the current semver object. Returns True if
        updated and False if not updated. Allows a consistant
        way to convert from System.Version to PSSemanticVersion.Version.
    ToSystemVersion - Returns a System.Version object based
        on the values of current semver object. the current
        semver object is attached to the System.Version as a
        NoteProperty named SemVer. Allows a consistant way to
        convert from PSSemanticVersion.Version to System.Version.
